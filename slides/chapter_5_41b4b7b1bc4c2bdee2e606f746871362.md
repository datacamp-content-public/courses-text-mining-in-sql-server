Good morning everyone. In today's lesson we will learn how to use the STRING_SPLIT function. In SQL Server this particular function is used to separate words in a corpus or even in a sentence. The STRING SPLIT function requires two parameters. The first parameter is the sentence in quotes and the second parameter is the delimiter. The delimiter is used to separate the text by various thing


---
## Basic Structure

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a262277119"
```

`@part1`
STRING_SPLIT('text', 'delimiter')


STRING_SPLIT('Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman', ',')


`@script`
The STRING SPLIT function requires two parameters. The first parameter is the sentence in quotes and the second parameter is the delimiter. The delimiter is used to separate the text by various things like the comma or the semi-colon

## Another Example

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "45c2b2df93"
```

`@part1`



`@script`



---
## Using Variables

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "b45ac46569"
```

`@part1`
DECLARE #HASTAG VARCHAR(50) = #SpiderManFarFromHome, @DELIMITER CHAR = ''

SELECT * FROM STRING_SPLIT(@HASHTAG, @DELIMITER)

## Time to do Practice Problems 

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"

Now that you have seen some examples on how to use the STRING_SPLIT() function now it is time to go over some practice problems
