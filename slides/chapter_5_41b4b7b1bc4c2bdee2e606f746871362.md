Good morning everyone. In today's lesson we will learn how to use the STRING_SPLIT function. In SQL Server this particular function is used to separate words in a corpus or in a sentence. The STRING SPLIT function the beginning step when it comes to the tokenization process which will be discussed in a later Chapter.


---
## Basic Structure

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a262277119"
```

`@part1`
STRING_SPLIT('text', 'delimiter')


`@script`
The STRING SPLIT function requires two parameters. The first parameter is the text in quotes and the second parameter is the delimiter. The delimiter is used to separate the text by various things like the comma or the semi-colon.


---
## Simple Example

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "45c2b2df93"
```

`@part1`
```STRING_SPLIT('Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman', ',')
```


`@script`
In this example the text we have three villains from the Spiderman universe that are separated by a comma. When using the SPLIT_STRING function we will insert the the text in quotes and use the comma as a delimiter in order to separate each villian.


---
## Using Variables

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "b45ac46569"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
DECLARE @example VARCHAR(50) = "Today-is-a-great-day-to-watch-Spiderman-Far-From-Home' 

@DELIMITER VARCHAR(50) = "-"

```SELECT * FROM STRING_SPLIT(@example, @DELIMITER)```


`@script`
The next example shows how to use the STRING_SPLIT function variables. Temp variables come in handy when it comes to  dealing with small amounts of data. Unlike a temp table, it does not use up a lot of memory and it disappears after the execution of the query. The delimiter is also stored in a variable.


---
## Using STRING_SPLIT with ORDER BY

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "63c490f628"
```

`@part1`
DECLARE @villians VARCHAR(50) = 'Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman'

```STRING_SPLIT('Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman', ',') ORDER BY ASC


`@script`
When using the STRING_SPLIT function you can order the words in alphabetical order by using the ORDER BY command. Using ASC orders the results from a-z and DES does the opposite.


---
## STRING_SPLIT with the LIKE and Order BY Clause

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a1b224a5be"
```

`@part1`
DECLARE @villians VARCHAR(50) = 'Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman'


SELECT * 
FROM STRING_SPLIT (@villians, ',')
WHERE @villians LIKE '%O%'
ORDER BY ASC;


`@script`
Now lets try it with a wildcard. When executed, this query will print the villains that contain the letter 'O' in alphabetical order. Wildcards is another method of filtering your results.


---
## STRING_SPLIT with the CONCAT function

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5a9c9ecfc1"
```

`@part1`
DECLARE @villians VARCHAR(50) = 'Hydro,Mysterio,Sandman'

@DELIMITER CHAR = ","

```CONCAT(@villians,'is my favorite villain')```


`@script`
Now lets try this with a concat function. CONCAT is useful when you are forming sentences in your result set. When executed this query will print three sentences. The name of a SpiderMan villain plus the string "is my favorite villain"


---
## Time to do Practice Problems

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "54077659ba"
```

`@script`
Now that you have seen some examples on how to use the STRING_SPLIT() function now it is time to go over some practice problems.
